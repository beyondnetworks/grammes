package traversal

// http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#by-step

// By (step modulator) similar to As() & Option(). If a step is able to
// accept traversals, functions, comparator, etc. then By() is the means by
// which they are added. The general pattern is step().By()...By(). Some steps
// can only accept one By() while others can take an arbitrary amount
// Signatures:
// By()
// By(string)
// By(...interface{})
func (g String) By(params ...interface{}) String {
	g.AddStep("by", params...)

	return g
}
